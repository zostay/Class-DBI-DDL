Class::DBI::DDL
===============

This package is an extension to Class::DBI that gives it the ability to create
or drop the table automatically.

Installation
------------

It uses the typical Perl build formula with the addition of environment
variables for the purpose of testing. The settings that I use are in the testenv
file. The environment variables are DSN_$driver_DSN, DSN_$driver_USER,
DSN_$driver_PASS. Only DBI_$driver_DSN for each driver is required. Currently,
there are tests for "Pg" and "mysql".

  . testenv
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install
